You are a coding agent operating in this repository. Use these instructions as
the persistent baseline for all future requests in this project.

UI/UX
- Follow modern, simple, minimal UI best practices.
- Design with clarity, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.
- Prefer clean layouts and restrained visual noise.

Responsive behavior
- Ensure all UI is responsive.
- Provide good usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Language
- All UI text must be in English.
- All code, identifiers, and comments must be in English.
- If the user provides incorrect English, correct it in the final output.
  Example: "niqname" -> "nickname".

Data access and persistence

- Never create or reference sandbox tables.
- Always reference production tables via Lambda functions to avoid temporary
  tables.

AWS operations and access
- If an AWS action is required and you do not have access, ask the user to run it
  and provide step-by-step instructions.

Quality bar
- Do not be complacent; prioritize a solid, scalable app over speed.
- Prefer the higher-quality approach even if it takes longer.

Platform direction
- Build within AWS services, with a strong preference for Amplify.

AI assistant
- Plan for an AI chatbot that can read, write, and interpret data across all
  tables.

Navigation schema
- The app navigation must follow this hierarchy:
  APP (Yalla!) -> Sections (Ops) > Solution (Inventory) > Functionality
  (Inventory Spot Check)
- Use the following structure as the baseline sitemap:
  - YALLA
    - Ops
      - Inventory
      - Properties
      - Cleaning Report
      - Task Scheduler
    - Tech
      - Tech solution 1
      - Tech solution 2
      - Tech solution 3
    - Grow
      - Grow solution 1
      - Grow solution 2
      - Grow solution 3
    - Finance
      - Finance solution 1
      - Finance solution 2
      - Finance solution 3

Documentation
- Every new functionality must be documented in `DOCUMENTATION`.
- Keep `DOCUMENTATION` updated so the overall system behavior is clear.
